# Broken-Link-Official
This is the Python script I have written in order to get all the urls from a database and check their status code. I have assumed the urls with status code 4xx or 5xx as broken links as it degrades the SEO of a website. THe code checks for all the URls and outputs a csv file with the URL and their respective status. The python script gets the Url and checks for it. There is plugin which will be used in a wordpress website to schedule an execution of this scriipt daily to get an analysis of the status off the website.
